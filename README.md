# Ackley-Optimization-and-Curve-fitting
My first c++ project.

A genetic algorithm program used to find the lowest point in a 3d graph and the best fit curve for an exponential equation
The algorithm uses mutation, crossover, fitness scores and generations to find an optimal solution.
Please view the document titled "project report" for further details.
